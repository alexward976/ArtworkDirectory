# Overview

This simple artwork directory app allows users to search for artworks and artists, and see images of those artworks.

The purpose of creating this app was so I could learn React Native and integrate with an existing API.

# Development Environment

This app was developed using Visual Studio Code and the Expo Go iOS mobile app. Expo Go allowed me to test the application in real time.

I used React Native and expo to create this application. I also installed an additional library called React Navigation to navigate between screens.

# Future Work

* Implement user sign in.
* Signed in users can 'favorite' artworks and save them in personal collections.
* Input validation on the search bar.
